I also like that you have your own 3D Printed part to replace the Redragon branding. Overall its a great video.  Just a clarification on hotswappable vs soldered: (and thus being that guy on the internet who makes very long comments) <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwaMGf_rfPQ&amp;t=1m30s>1:30</a>  If the switches are soldered directly to the PCB you cant just remove the switches like what you did even with some force. You basically confirmed that the PCB is hotswappable (without really knowing at the time that its hotswappable) because you CAN remove the switches like what is shown.  <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwaMGf_rfPQ&amp;t=2m04s>2:04</a>  Again the fact that you can put the switch back in the PCB and confirm that it still works means that the switches are hotswappable.  Whats actually soldered on the board is the sockets (the extruding metal part where you put the metal pins of the switch into to demonstrate that the switch can connect easily without the need to solder the switch). A similar type of hotswap socket to whats found here (which Im guessing is Outemu sockets) is Millmax sockets. The sockets act as a medium between the switch and the PCB connection.",61,5,-0.32891387,7.573215],
